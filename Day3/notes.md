# Day 3 Notes
Part 1 is incredibly simple, no explanation is needed. Part 2 is also easy, but I discovered how lists in Python can be assigned True or False values depending on whether or not there are contents in them. This let me work with a while loop, popping elements from a list and grouping them together to find a common letter until the main list no longer has any elements. I too made sure to remove elements from the end of the list in order to get an efficient algorithm (~~I originally thought of a queue~~ having an efficient algorithm actually does not matter because the goal is to only get the answer).
