# Day 5

## Part 1
In this part, I used lists to simulate stacks. I chose not to use stacks, because I did not feel like it. I know that a stack could be implemented from the `collectios.deque` class, which was my original idea until I decided it would be more important to focus on the actual algorithm rather than the data structures and efficiency of the algorithm. As typical with this year's challenges, there was some work needed to gather the input correctly.
